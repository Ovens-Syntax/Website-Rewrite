<h2>Overall Statement of Intent</h2>
<p>
I decided to make an app for pour over coffee because I already had a lot of general ideas for interesting app features based off of apps I've liked using, like the way that Pedometer++'s stat page is implemented on iOS. The idea to implement these features and UI ideas around coffee came from my interview with my father, who enjoys pour over coffee when I make it, but does not know how to do it himself, as the recipe and technique is not particularly intuitive. 
<br></br>
For design inspiration, I looked at apps with very different purposes that implemented interesting features well, and thought about how I could apply that to my app's context. I already noted Pedometer++. I also took inspiration from apps like Knittrick, my mother's app for knitting, which has UI elements like rectangular buttons with rounded corners, which I found fit in to my design well. The final piece of inspiration for the UI that comes to mind was the calendar, which is designed to be similar to GitHub commit calendars, where it displays 0 with grey, 1 with a light green, and numbers above 1 with increasingly darker greens, which I like because it makes the information faster to parse than with just numbers. 
<br></br>
In terms of the UX, I wanted to make the application comprehensible easily and have a distinct look, which I tried to achieve mostly through my drawn assets. I'm not particularly talented at art, so I traced images of coffee equipment I have at home in Adobe Illustrator on the iPad. I like the effect of these simple line drawings because they make the application more eye-catching while not distracting too much from the important information.
<br></br>
For the logo, I tried to make a more simplistic clip art icon so that it would stand out more at a smaller size. This is the reason why it is colored, because the key point of it is to draw the user's attention. I chose light blue because it is a passive color and the application is supposed to have a calming effect and not to look aggressive. My original idea was to have the mug have some sort of writing on it, or an image, but I decided against it, as it would be harder to comprehend at the smaller size. If I had more time to work on the icon, I probably would add steam, like the one mug in the prototype has. 
<br></br>
Finally, in terms of the name, it was one of the elements I considered less than other ones. My main objective with the name was to make my application have a distinct brand identity, instead of referencing all of the other brands with coffee-oriented names, like JavaScript, for example. This is why I settled on "Bean Juice", because it references the purpose of the application in a way that is unique and distinct from other existing brands. It is also memorable because it is a bit odd which means the user is more likely to remember it.
