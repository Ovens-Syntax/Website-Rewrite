<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am Owen Hughes.  I am fifteen years old and I am currently in grade 10.  I have moved every 3 years or so for almost all of my life, which means that many things in my life have not been very consistent.  However, I have always been interested in making things.  When I was younger, I really enjoyed making things with Lego.  As I became older, I would try to make things on my own with tools.  And now I do a lot of things related to Computer Aided Design and software.
<br>
<br>
In class, we filled out a number of tests about our careers that gave us a variety of results, but none of them were very surprising to me.  In fact, many of them were things I had already been considering in terms of my future career path.  The first program we did was SparkPath, which used a method of trying to find broad challenges that we were interested in and telling us to focus on working on that instead of a traditional model where you just look at careers.  I found that this was an interesting idea, although I think that it was the least polished of the three.  The challenges it found for me were Distribute the Wealth, Build Great Products, and Use Technology and Computers.  I think the final two were the most accurate, and Distribute the Wealth may have come from my personal values, which it misinterpreted as a career interest.  The other two were fairly accurate and fit well with my interest in design and technology.  Xello is a much more traditional career platform that takes in information about you and tries to match you with jobs it thinks you might fit well with.  I thought, again, that some of these were fairly accurate while some of them were not.  An example of a result that I thought was fairly accurate was Industrial Designer, which I have been looking at for a year or so as a career that I would like to pursue.  The final test was a much more traditional diagnostic test that used a test-like structure and then translated that into career clusters or areas that it felt the student might be interested in.  I felt that this gave the best results, because it gave the broadest results possible.  It matched me with three career clusters, two related to technology and one related to art.  The technology ones were differentiated by the level of technology work.  The job that I liked the best of the ones that were suggested was Industrial Designer, unsurprisingly, since this is the career that I am interested in doing.
<br>
<br> 
I feel that these tests and my previous life experiences have all pointed me in a fairly consistent direction, which is that I like to make things.  I already knew this about myself, but I feel that this course has further cemented my belief in this opinion. Thus, I would like to pursue a career that involves making products or, more broadly, pursue a line towards that career even if I don't end up going into Industrial Design, as I think this skill set is mainly what I am after.  In the short term, I will continue to work on personal projects that involve design, as that is how I have learned and gotten better at the skills that would be necessary to take up a career path like this.  Although I have other interests, like world affairs and politics, I find that they don't translate as well to things that I enjoy doing, which is why I feel that the Industrial Design career path is best suited to me.
