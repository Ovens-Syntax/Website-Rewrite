<h2>Overall Statement of Intent</h2>
<p>
this was a school project to make 3 highly edited selfies with the twist that they were to be promotional material of some kind because of my love of music
i decided to make 3 concept album covers. the first album cover i made was one with the title Neon Future in terms of design i wanted it too emulate the 
aesthetic of the techno genre for this theme the teqniuqes i used are as follows one in terms of color i used black and green this was because it makes me 
think of films like the matrix and more generally the way hacking is typically portrayed, two in terms of font i chose a font with a sci-fi look to make emfasize
the technological theme, three i used an effect to make the image be composed of lines to further emulate the wavy look of some techno album covers. the second
album cover i made was one with the title Dead Walking in terms of design my goal was too depict some elements of the genres punk rock and heavy metal 
this was achived with some teqniuqes one in terms of color this uses a pallete of red and black this is because these colors are a staple of the subgenre of 
punk rock anarcho punk this is also the reason for the way that the image is divided into two triangular sections of colors as this is another staple of anarcho punk 
imagery two in terms of typography i used a blackletter font as i felt it fit with the overall image and two blackletter is a staple of heavy metal imagery
overall the secound piece was heavily inspired by my practice work and used an evolved version of my teqniuqe of using the cutout filter in combonation with 
a strong color shift unfortunatly this piece falls a bit short in terms of theme but overall i think it is decently put together. the third album cover i made was 
one called Panopticon this one was done only a couple of hours before i wrote this paragrauph so i am somewhat biased towards it but it is currently my favorite 
Panopticon diverges from the other two pieces because it is less driven by a specific music genre and more by the theme of survielance and security camera footage
to achive this i used a black and white color pallete which i achieved through my typical teqniuqe of of the cutout filter in combination with a colorshift to 
further emphasize the idea of a security camera i used an ultrawide lens so the image is distorted in a similar way to a security camera unfortunatly the croping of 
the image reduced this effect the last 2 things i did to convey the idea of a security camera was to add a decent amount of film grain and to pixelate the image i 
could talk about these pieces for a long time but this Statement is running a bit long so i am going to end it here.
